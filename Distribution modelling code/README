. CVRP_distribution.py: This contains code which has been borrowed from the internet for a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem.
. Elevationmap.py: This contains code which has been borrowed from the internet and adapted to create a topographic map of Oxford.
. electrolyser_location_optimisation.m: This contains MATLAB code which optimises the electrolyser location. The optimisation is based on how much trailers would have to travel to distribute hyrogen to depots in Oxford.
. plant_location_model_updated.py: This contains Python code which optimises the electroylser location.
