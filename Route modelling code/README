This folder contains code used for route modelling for the Green Hydrogen Public Mobility Project. A title and description for each code is shown below.
. Database.py: This is a dataframe containing information on Oxford bus routes
. Gallons.py: This code estimates the gallons of diesel used by buses in Oxford. The code does not distinguish between weekends and weekdays.
. codeforcompiled.py: This contains code for creating a diagram of how bus consumptions compare in Oxford
. codeforindividual.py: This contains code for creating a diagram showing how much a single bus route consumes diesel in Oxford
. dataframe_distance_weekend.py: This code contains a dataframe for bus routes in weekends
. emissions_weekend.py: This code estimates how much CO2 different bus routes emit on weekends
. gallons_weekday.py: This code estimates how many gallons of diesel each bus route in Oxford consumes on a weekday
. gallons_weekend.py: This code estimates how many gallons of diesel each bus route in Oxford consumes on a weekend
. hydrogen_estimate_weekend.py: This code estiamtes how much equivalent hydrogen would be required by different bus routes on a weekend
. individual_bus_plots_weekend.py: This code estiamtes how much equivalent hydrogen would be required by a single bus route on a weekend
. range_model_updated.py: This code estimates the range covered by Park and Ride routes in a single day
