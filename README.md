# 3YP-Code
This repository contains code for the 3YP Green Hydrogen Public Mobility Project

Code is arranged into the following folders:
1) Distribution modelling code:
. This contains code used for determining the optimum location of the electrolyser.
. This folder also contains Oxford mapping code.
2) Regenerative braking modelling code:
. This folder contains code used for modellign the energy which could be recovered for regenerative braking.
3) Route modelling code:
. This is a folder containing code used for route modelling. Sasha and Akshay have also contributed to the code and the dataframes used. 
. The code aims to estimate the gallons used, CO2 emmitted and hydrogen equivalent amounts required by current Oxford bus fleets.
4) Price modelling code:
. This is a folder containing code used for extrapolating bus prices.

This folder also includes a test program and some practice code:
. triangular_test.py: This is code which outputs traingular numbers
. LEO_3YP_python_intro_MT2.ipynb: This is practice code used in the 3rd week of Michaelmas term
